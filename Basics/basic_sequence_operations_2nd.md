:fork_and_knife:Element extraction and Slicing :knife:
-------------------------------

What does it mean? That means we want to extract one or more elements from the sequence using "INDEXING"

Indexing is the process of accessing a single element in a sequence by specifying the index in square brackets ([]). The index starts from 0, so the first element has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on. 

Let's try to extract an element from the car string.You can get any element giving an index position of the element in a square bracket. So in this example, I am extracting the second element from my car and so on.
