***Python Collections (Arrays): *******

There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.

Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.

Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.

Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

What is SET in python ??

Sets is used to store multiple items in single variable.
Set is unordered, unchanged and unindexed.


Sets are written with curly braces {}. Now we have seen this {} in dictionary, dictionary holds key:value pairs , however sets hold collection of unique elements only.


basic example of set :

 A set can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, tuple, string etc.).
 
 --But a set cannot have mutable elements like lists, sets or dictionaries as its elements.

### Create an Empty Set in Python ##

Creating empty set is bit tricky beacuse if we use {} python will take it as Dictionary. See example below, so we have to use SET to create empty set .
