== Working with list and tuples ==

A tuple is a collection of Python objects separated by commas, which is similar to a List. The most crucial difference between the two of them is the mutability. 


:white_check_mark: list is a mutable object. We enclose lists in square brackets [].

:negative_squared_cross_mark: A tuple is immutable. We enclose tuples in parentheses().

*The elements inside a list or a tuple can be of a heterogenous type, which means you can mix different types of objects
