How to work with Date and Time in python :

Python doesnt have any standard moduke for date and time, we have to import the datetime moddule from the python library.
The data time module offers four classes to efficently work with date and time :
 1) date
 2) time
 3) datetime
 4) timedelta

All the objects of these classes are immutable. So once defined, you cannot change it.
However, we can manipulate them and create a new object
