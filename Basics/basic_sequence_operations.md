Sequences in  Python:
  ------------------------

  A sequence in python refers to an ordered collection of items , in which each element is accesible by its position or index in sequence.
  Python offers you three basic type of sequence type:

    1) List
    2) Tuples
    3) Range
    4) String



Sting also falls in Sequences, because it is an ordered collection of characters, where each character has a unique position or index in the sequence.

Mutability:
-----------

In python , only  List seqeunce is  "MUTABLE", others are "UNMUTABLE".
What it means that if sequence is mutable then , we can change state or content , if sequence type is immutable , you cannot change its state or content.


We will see some list of common opertaions in sequences:
---------------------------------------------------------


1) Comparison of the same type.


You can compare sequence of same types. lets see examples-

 Comparing strings here :
 -----------------------

Now lets compare some "LIST" types:
----------------------------------

![Snip20230129_18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93876736/215328107-9c6cae67-a42f-4838-a8c9-cb45ebd9a698.png)


-------------------------
2) Containment (in, not in)
-------------------------

A containment test in Python checks if an element is present in a sequence. This is typically done using the 'in' and 'not in' operator.

The in operator works with all sequences , such as tuples, sets, and strings.


![Snip20230129_19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93876736/215345862-cce89fcd-3a7a-4b76-805f-8ac4c052b4a8.png)

Now in above example , In the firstcontainment test on string, we are trying to find ‘h’ in the name. Does it exist? No. So the outcome is FALSE.
likewise we did other search.
