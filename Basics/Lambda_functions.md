What is a Lambda Function?

Lambda functions are similar to user-defined functions but without a name. 
They're commonly referred to as anonymous functions.


* Lambda functions are efficient whenever you want to create a function that will only contain simple expressions â€“ that is, 
expressions that are usually a single line of a statement. 
* They're also useful when you want to use the function once.

Below is the syntax to define Lambda function:


--> lambda argument(s) : expression


1) lambda is a keyword in Python for defining the anonymous function.
2) argument(s) is a placeholder, that is a variable that will be used to hold the value you want to pass into the function expression. 
 A lambda function can have multiple variables depending on what you want to achieve.
 
3) expression is the code you want to execute in the lambda function.
