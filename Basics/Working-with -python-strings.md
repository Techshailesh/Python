Lets learm some string functionalities:

-------------------------------------------
1.String Literals
-------------------------------------------

what does STRING LITERALs mean ??? 
A string literal can be created by writing a text(a group of Characters ) surrounded by a single(”), double(“”), or triple quotes.  By using triple quotes we can write multi-line strings or display them in the desired way. 

we can create a string literal using single or double-quotes. Why do we have two options? 
This flexibility helps us to create strings that contain a single quote or double quote within the string literal. 

In quote 1 , we can see that I have used '' literal and within that tried to include " " , it accepted.
but in quote 2 , when i have used " " and again tried to include " " , it not accepted. 
likewise in other example

we also have triple quotes. You can use either three single quotes or three double-quotes to create multi-line strings. Here is an example shown

**Using / to include special characters in literals**

We can also use a backslash to escape special characters in a Python string. Here is an escaping example shown below. We have escaped the single quotes using the backslash character. 
What if we don't use the backslash character? Well, it will give me an error saying invalid syntax. It is because the string ended here, so it doesn't understand the remaining part of the string.

** Adding new line using /n **

We can also add a new line or some extra spaces in the string using the escape character as shown below
