                                        **** LIST COMPREHENSION ****

:rocket: We often need to create a new list by transforming an existing List. 
List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

Lets see a basic example to understand :bangbang:

 We can also use filter condition, lets see some example below:

Assume we have a list of tuples. Each tuple pair represents a length and breadth of a rectangle. And now we want to transform this list like the areaslist shown in the next cell.Each element is a multiplication of the length and breadth.
