Python Functions is a block of statements that return the specific task.
The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again. 


Types of function:

There are two types of function in Python programming:

* Standard library functions - These are built-in functions in Python that are available to use.
* User-defined functions - We can create our own functions based on our requirements.
