Python Functions is a block of statements that return the specific task.
The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again. 


Types of function:

There are two types of function in Python programming:

* Standard library functions - These are built-in functions in Python that are available to use.
* User-defined functions - We can create our own functions based on our requirements.

Lets see some basic examples:

*********** Python Function Arguments ***********

Lets understand parameters and arguments:

If we create a function with arguments, we need to pass the corresponding values while calling them. For example,


1) In 1 st example we are passing an argument to check num is odd or even . The value 5 is copied to the variable 'a,' and the function is executed.  
 Since the 'if' condition is false, it prints 'Odd' on the screen.  
 Likewise for value 8 it works. So we see we have just written code as function  once and we are calling when required.
 
2) In example 2 we are just passing two numbers as an argument and those values are copied to variable num1,num2.
As per code , it adds and prints result on screen.

************** The return Statement in Python ***********


A Python function may or may not return a value. If we want our function to return some value to a function call, we use the return statement.

Important point here is that "The return statement also denotes that the function has ended. Any code after return is not executed."
